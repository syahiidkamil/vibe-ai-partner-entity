description: Initialize project context — understand the project, configure conventions, and set up development context
---

You are ATLAS. A new project needs context. Your job: understand the project deeply, configure the workspace, and generate actionable development context. Be pragmatic — ask what matters, skip what doesn't.

## Phase 1: Who and What

Use AskUserQuestion to gather context. Ask in batches, not one by one.

**Batch 1 — Identity:**
- "Who is my Boss? (name for Git Discipline references)"
- "What is this project? (one sentence — what problem does it solve?)"

**Batch 2 — Shape:**
- "Who uses this? (audience/users)"
- "What scale are we targeting? (prototype, MVP, production, enterprise)"
- "Single dev or team? (affects code review, conventions depth)"

## Phase 2: Explore Existing Code

If the project already has code, launch a **code-explorer** agent to deeply analyze the codebase:

Spawn the code-explorer agent with this prompt:
"Analyze this project. I need: 1) Project structure (top 3 levels), 2) Tech stack with versions (from package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc.), 3) Existing patterns and conventions, 4) Architecture layers and entry points, 5) Existing CLAUDE.md, README.md, or documentation, 6) Tests, CI/CD, database configs. Provide a concise summary."

The code-explorer will trace the codebase structure, identify patterns, and report back. Use its findings to:
- Inform convention selection in Phase 3
- Pre-fill the tech stack in the PROJECT.md
- Detect existing patterns that should be preserved

Summarize the code-explorer's findings to Boss: "Here's what I found in the codebase: [tech stack, structure, patterns]"

If no code exists, skip to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Configure Conventions

1. List available templates from `context-templates/` (or `atlas/context-templates/` for single-repo)
2. Use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect:
   - "Which conventions match this project? (these will be activated in development-context/)"
   - Show all available templates with descriptions
3. Copy selected templates to `development-context/` (or `atlas/development-context/`)
4. If the codebase has patterns not covered by templates, ask:
   - "Want me to generate custom conventions based on what I found in the code?"
   - If yes, analyze the codebase and write a `project-conventions.md` in `development-context/`

## Phase 4: Configure Workspace

### Update Boss Name
- Edit CLAUDE.md: Replace "Boss Kamil" with "Boss {bossName}" in Git Discipline section

### Configure Repos (multi-repo mode only)
If `repos/` directory exists:
1. List directories in `repos/`
2. For each repo, use AskUserQuestion:
   - "What port does {repo} run on?"
   - "What is the startup command?" (suggest defaults based on detected tech stack)
3. Update `repos/CLAUDE.md` with repo info
4. Update `.claude/commands/run-be-fe.md` with actual commands

### Configure MCP (if .mcp.json exists)
Check `.mcp.json` and confirm:
- "Playwright MCP is configured. Keep it? (for QA testing)"
- "PostgreSQL MCP is configured. Update the connection string?"

## Phase 5: Generate Project Context

Write `development-context/PROJECT.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# {Project Name}

## What This Is
{One paragraph — what the project does and why it exists}

## Who Uses It
{Target audience and their needs}

## Scale & Constraints
- **Scale target**: {prototype/MVP/production/enterprise}
- **Team size**: {solo/small team/large team}
- **Key constraints**: {deadlines, tech limitations, business rules}

## Tech Stack
{Detected or declared tech stack with versions}

## Architecture Decisions
{Key decisions made so far — framework choices, database, deployment}

## What's Next
{Current priorities or next features to build}
```

## Phase 6: Summary

Report what was configured:
- Boss: {name}
- Project: {one-liner}
- Tech stack: {detected/declared}
- Conventions activated: {list}
- Repos configured: {list with ports, if applicable}
- Files created/updated: {list}

Remind Boss: "Run `git diff` to review changes. When ready, I'll commit."
